# About Me
Hello! I am a Ph.D. Student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) at Harvard University advised by [Professor Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Professor Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). My primary research focus is in building ML/AI systems applied to prevalent issues in the medical field. Currently I am investigating designing Gaussian Process priors to optimize learning for reinforcement learning algorithms.

Before coming to Harvard, I was a Technical Lead at Amazon, developing on backend, desktop, mobile web, and mobile app platforms for the configurable, contextual and personalized navigation experience for Wholefoods Market, Prime Now, & Amazon Fresh.

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Mathematics: Computer Science Concentration with a minor in American U.S. History from the University of California, Berkeley. I was on course staff for Math 128A Numerical Analysis and EECS 61C Machine Structures, served as the Residence Hall Assembly President, and received the Campus Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award from the [UC Berkeley EECS department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) in 2019.
